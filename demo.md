<title>Intended Use ###</title><comment old-location="0" creation-date="07/02/2024 08:03:33" color="#0000FF" creator="Marina Kovacevic" id="350410671">### the intended use. What is the purpose of CSIBox? Cheap and simple control of scan system(s). Is
CSIBox part of SCU or SCB cabinet or is it separate? Separate. It replaces both. Why do we need SC in SCU and a separate CSIBox in the same setup? We don't, the customer will either buy SCU/SCB or CSIBox. It uses RTC to control the scanner? Yes. Can it be
used independently (without RTC)? No. </comment> 
<p>The CSIBox is intended to be used in an industrial environment mainly in manufacturing processes or for process control. </p> 
<p>It is intended to provide user with simple and affordable control of one or more scan systems simultaneously.</p> 
<p>It provides single point of entry for all safety and communication relevant data transfer. It's PLC variants provides fieldbus extension for easy connection of RTC EtherBox to PLC.</p> 
<subheading>Advantages</subheading> 
<p>Using the CSIBox brings several advantages:</p> 
<ul type="disc"> 
<li> 
<p>Ethernet-based fieldbus connection</p></li> 
<li> 
<p>Quick integration of RTC EtherBox in any industrial plant via different variants of fieldbus interfaces </p></li> 
<li> 
<p>Having one fieldbus master instance controlling several RTC EtherBoxes </p></li> 
<li> 
<p>Additional control options via industrial digital I/Os</p></li> 
<li> 
<p>Mapping of RTC and laser signals on fieldbus level</p></li> 
<li> 
<p>Possibility for optional connection of safety-related signals</p></li> 
<li> 
<p>Possibility for optional execution of logic on the CSIBox (customer responsibility) </p></li></ul> 
<p>The data transfer via fieldbus interface is conducted according to industry standards. </p> 
<subheading>Prerequisites</subheading>
